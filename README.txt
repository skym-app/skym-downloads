- Skym Package

This package includes controller scripts and presets to get Skym working with your DAW.

If your standard folders for music software are in a custom location, you will have to skip the installer and move the files to your location.

- Custom Install

If your music software folders are not in a standard location, or cannot run the .pkg installer, here is where to put each item...

- Ableton
move this folder '/skym-downloads/Ableton/SkymAbletonScript' to '/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts'
if 'Remote Scripts' is not a folder, create it.
The standard location for this 'Ableton' folder is 'User/Music/Ableton', but the User Library can be located in Ableton Preferences / Library

- Serum
move this folder '/skym-downloads/Serum/SkymSerumPresets' to your Serum Presets Folder.

In Serum, click Menu (top right) then Show Serum Presets folder. Open the Presets folder.

- Logic Pro
move this folder '/skym-downloads/Logic/SkymAlchemyPresets' to '~/Audio Music Apps/Plug-In Settings/Alchemy/SkymAlchemyPresets'
